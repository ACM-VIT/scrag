## Task Overview

**Task Title:** [Brief descriptive title]
**Parent Epic:** [Link to parent epic - #epic-number]
**Related Issues:** [Links to related issues]
**Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Estimated Effort:** [X hours/days]

## Description

<!-- Detailed description of what needs to be implemented -->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Define specific, testable acceptance criteria -->

- [ ] [Criteria 1 - specific, measurable behavior]
- [ ] [Criteria 2 - specific, measurable behavior]
- [ ] [Criteria 3 - error handling scenario]
- [ ] [Criteria 4 - performance requirement]

## Technical Specification

### Implementation Details
- **Component/Module:** [Where the code will live]
- **Interface Changes:** [New or modified interfaces]
- **Configuration:** [New configuration options]
- **Dependencies:** [New dependencies required]

### Architecture Considerations
- [ ] [Follows PipelineStage interface pattern]
- [ ] [Integrates with existing error handling]
- [ ] [Maintains backward compatibility]
- [ ] [Follows established patterns]

## Test Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] [Test scenario 1 - happy path]
- [ ] [Test scenario 2 - error handling]
- [ ] [Test scenario 3 - edge cases]
- [ ] [Test scenario 4 - configuration validation]

### Integration Tests
- [ ] [Integration test 1 - component interaction]
- [ ] [Integration test 2 - end-to-end workflow]

### Performance Tests (if applicable)
- [ ] [Performance test 1 - load testing]
- [ ] [Performance test 2 - memory usage]

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] [API documentation updated]
- [ ] [Configuration documentation]
- [ ] [User guide sections]
- [ ] [Architecture documentation]
- [ ] [Code comments and docstrings]

## Configuration Changes

```yaml
# Example of configuration additions/changes
new_feature:
  enabled: true
  setting1: "default_value"
  setting2: 100
```

## Dependencies

### Code Dependencies
- [ ] [Dependency 1 - specific task/issue]
- [ ] [Dependency 2 - external library]

### Design Dependencies
- [ ] [UI/UX design complete]
- [ ] [API specification finalized]
- [ ] [Architecture decision made]

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- [ ] [Step 1 - basic structure]
- [ ] [Step 2 - core logic]
- [ ] [Step 3 - basic testing]

### Phase 2: Integration
- [ ] [Step 4 - integration with existing components]
- [ ] [Step 5 - configuration integration]
- [ ] [Step 6 - error handling]

### Phase 3: Polish
- [ ] [Step 7 - comprehensive testing]
- [ ] [Step 8 - documentation]
- [ ] [Step 9 - performance optimization]

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [High/Med/Low] | [Mitigation strategy] |
| [Risk 2] | [High/Med/Low] | [Mitigation strategy] |
