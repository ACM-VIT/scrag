# Web Crawler Architecture Spike

**Status:** In Progress  
**Start Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Time Box:** 2 weeks  
**Spike Lead:** [To be assigned]  

## Objective

Design a robust, scalable web crawling architecture that integrates with the existing Scrag pipeline while supporting the Universal RAG Builder feature.

## Research Questions

- [ ] How should we discover relevant URLs from user queries?
- [ ] What rate limiting and politeness policies should we implement?
- [ ] How do we handle JavaScript-heavy sites and dynamic content?
- [ ] What deduplication strategies work best at scale?
- [ ] How do we integrate with existing extractor/processor pipeline?
- [ ] What error handling and retry mechanisms are needed?
- [ ] How do we store and manage crawl job state?

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear architecture diagram for crawling system
- [ ] Decision on discovery query → search → fetch workflow
- [ ] Recommendation for error handling and retry strategies
- [ ] Integration plan with existing pipeline components
- [ ] Performance and scalability considerations documented
- [ ] Prototype demonstrating key concepts

## Investigation Approach

### 1. Architecture Research
- Review existing crawler architectures (Scrapy, Nutch, etc.)
- Analyze integration patterns with existing Scrag pipeline
- Research distributed crawling patterns

### 2. Discovery Mechanisms
- Web search APIs (Google Custom Search, Bing, etc.)
- Social media APIs for trending content
- RSS/Atom feed aggregation
- Sitemap discovery and parsing

### 3. Performance & Scalability
- Benchmark crawling speeds with different approaches
- Memory usage patterns for large URL queues
- Concurrent request handling strategies

### 4. Prototype Development
- Basic proof-of-concept crawler
- Integration with existing extractors
- Error handling demonstration

## Key Components to Design

### 1. Discovery Query Stage
- **Purpose:** Convert user intent to search strategy
- **Input:** User query (e.g., "latest ML research papers")
- **Output:** Search strategy and parameters
- **Considerations:** Query expansion, source selection

### 2. Search Stage  
- **Purpose:** Find relevant URLs from various sources
- **Input:** Search strategy from Discovery Query
- **Output:** Ranked list of URLs to crawl
- **Considerations:** Multiple source aggregation, deduplication

### 3. Fetch Stage
- **Purpose:** Retrieve content with error handling
- **Input:** URL list from Search stage
- **Output:** Raw content for processing
- **Considerations:** Rate limiting, retry logic, robotics.txt compliance

### 4. Process Stage
- **Purpose:** Clean and normalize fetched content
- **Input:** Raw content from Fetch stage  
- **Output:** Processed content ready for embedding
- **Considerations:** Integration with existing processors

### 5. CrawlManager
- **Purpose:** Orchestrate entire crawling workflow
- **Responsibilities:** Job management, error recovery, progress tracking
- **Considerations:** Persistence, monitoring, resource management

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Criteria
- **Scalability:** Handle 1000+ URLs per job
- **Reliability:** <5% failure rate with proper retry
- **Performance:** Process 10+ URLs per minute
- **Memory Usage:** <1GB for typical crawl jobs
- **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing pipeline

### Quality Criteria
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns
- **Testability:** Easy to unit and integration test
- **Configurability:** Flexible configuration options
- **Observability:** Good logging and metrics
