# Guides

Scrag ships with two living documents that mirror the current implementation.

## Available Guides

- `getting-started.md` – Install Scrag with `uv`, run the Typer CLI, and understand the default configuration layout.
- `development.md` – Contributor workflow covering tests, code quality expectations, and how to extend the extractor/processor/storage registries.

Additional guides will land here as the project grows. Contributions are welcome; follow the structure in these documents when proposing a new guide.
